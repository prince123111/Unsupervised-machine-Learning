DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning. 
Unlike k-means clustering, which requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance, DBSCAN can automatically detect the number of 
clusters based on the data.


Here are the key concepts and features of DBSCAN:
Density-Based Clustering: DBSCAN groups together points that are closely packed together, while marking points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers.

Core Points, Border Points, and Noise:
Core Point: A point that has at least a minimum number of points (MinPts) within a specified radius (ε, epsilon).
Border Point: A point that has fewer than MinPts within ε but is in the neighborhood of a core point.
Noise Point: A point that is neither a core point nor a border point, often considered an outlier.

Parameters:
ε (Epsilon): The radius around a point to determine the neighborhood.
MinPts: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region (core point).


Algorithm Steps:
For each point in the dataset, check if it is a core point by counting the number of points within ε.
If it is a core point, form a cluster that includes all points within ε.
Expand the cluster by recursively including density-reachable points (points that are within ε of any point in the cluster).
Mark points that are not part of any cluster as noise.

Advantages:
Can find clusters of arbitrary shape.
Does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.
Can handle noise and outliers effectively.

Disadvantages:
Requires tuning of ε and MinPts parameters.
May struggle with datasets of varying densities.
Here’s a visual illustration of how DBSCAN works:


DBSCAN is particularly useful in applications like anomaly detection, geographic data analysis, and identifying clusters in spatial data.
